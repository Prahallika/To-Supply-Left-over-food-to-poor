# To-Supply-Left-over-food-to-poor
The project to supply leftover food to poor people is an initiative that aims to tackle two major issues: food waste and hunger. The concept behind this project is simple yet impactfulâ€”collect surplus food from restaurant and distribute it to underprivileged and impoverished communities through a well-coordinated system.
